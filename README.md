# JavaScript-SimsonGame
This project is a digital version of the classic Simon game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simon is a memory game where players must repeat a sequence of lights. Test your memory and reflexes!
Start the game by flipping a button. Then try to find another button that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped button will be flipped back with the face down.
